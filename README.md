This is a project that I use as a personal tool to have insights on the Stocks Market. 
It is made on a Three-Tiers Architecture, each level is made to run in its own container, within a same Docker Network. 


**The Main Functionnalities:** 

-> Have an overview of a title and its social reputation. (Given Semi-Objectively by Chat-GPT :) ) 

-> Compare the historic value of the stocks I am following for a given period. (It needs some work to calculate properly the stocks where a split occured in the past). 

-> Get the News about a title, for a given period. (I am unsatisfied with the results from the third party API, I am exploring a new one).

-> Get the Financial Information of the companies. 

*PS: You might see classes related to Identity Server. Logins on the website is a task I have started, but set aside for the moment, since I am the only user of the website for the moment.*


**Learnign Objectives:** 

-> Learn more about Docker; 

-> Learn Typescript and React (I am a backend developper). 


**Technologies:** 

-> SQL Server 2022; 

-> C#, .NET 8; 

-> Typerscript, React; 

-> Docker (Linux Container, Ubuntu 20.0.4 for server);
